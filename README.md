# Simple BrainF Interpreter

## How to compile?
Compiling is simple and only required GCC. Just run
```
./compile.sh
```

This will be later changed into a makefile.

## How do I use it?

Once you successfully compile it, its just a matter of passing the directory of the file you wish to execute as a CLI arg.
```
./brainc testing/helloworld.bf
```
